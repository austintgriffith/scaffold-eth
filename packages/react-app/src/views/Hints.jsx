        Open 3 terminals in root folder<br />

        Copy packages/react-app/src/contracts/CopyToNoun.abi.js content into 'Noun.abi.js'<br />
        You should now have in YourContract frontpage 4 contracts with its functions <br />
        You can mint the Stoodges tokens from there and send it to your accounts<br />
        Open an incongnito window to interact with different burner wallets<br />
        Feed yourself freely from the faucet<br />
        Ok! start creating wills with the functions, you can fund them with raw ETH and StoodgesTokens<br/>
        If you interact from components in YourContract, remember to convert amount to Hex<br/>
        In Create there are elements for wills creation (currently with a problem), also reference of timestamp (for a new will you need a timestamp > now)<br/>
        In Manage you can see a simple event catcher (only for creation) with simple interaction<br />
